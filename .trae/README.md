# Trae Configuration Directory

This directory is used to store Trae-specific configurations and resources.

## Contents

- `rules.md`: A copy of the project's rules (synchronized with `.cursorrules` in the root directory).
- You can add other Trae-specific configuration files here.

## Note

Trae is fully compatible with `.cursorrules` in the project root. This directory serves as a dedicated location for Trae-specific settings if needed.
