# Trae/Cursor Rules for MPV-Electron

This file is automatically generated from the rules in `.cursor/rules/`.

## 🎯 Core Principles

**Force Rule: Plan First, Then Execute**
For any code modification request, you must first provide a detailed implementation plan. Only when the user explicitly says "start implementation", "execute", "implement", "go", etc., should you modify the code.

**Exception: Fast Track (Quick Fix)**
For trivial changes (typos, comments, one-line bug fixes, config tweaks) that do not affect architecture or logic flow, you may skip the formal planning phase. However, you must still:
1. Briefly state what you are doing.
2. Verify the change after implementation.

**Force Rule: Real-time Architecture Documentation Update**
The architecture document (`docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`) must be updated in real-time with code/architecture changes in the same round of work. It is forbidden to wait for the user to remind you. Any changes involving interfaces, data structures, IPC, layering, state machines, file paths, etc., must be updated in the corresponding chapters and charts of the architecture document at the same time as the code modification is completed.

## 📋 Agent Workflow (Based on Andrew Ng's Pattern)

### Core Design Principles
1. **Reflection**: Reflect on your output, check for errors or areas for improvement.
2. **Planning**: Break down complex tasks into executable subtasks.
3. **Tool Use**: Be clear about when to use tools and how to choose the most appropriate one.
4. **Action**: Execute tasks according to the plan.
5. **Review**: Review the execution results to ensure quality.

### Standard Workflow

#### Phase 1: Understand & Reflect
1. **Read user requirements carefully**: Identify explicit/implicit requirements and constraints.
2. **Understand business goals and context**: What problem does this solve? Relationship with existing features? User scenarios?
3. **Reflect on understanding**: Do I fully understand? Any ambiguities? Need clarification?
4. **Identify relevant files and modules**: Use `codebase_search` and `grep`.

#### Phase 2: Analyze & Plan
1. **Search existing implementations (Must prioritize)**:
   - Use `codebase_search` and `grep`.
   - **Avoid duplicate implementation**.
   - **Identify reusable code modules**.
   - **CRITICAL: If designing new interfaces/types, must search existing callers first to understand actual data formats.**
2. **Analyze existing data formats**:
   - IPC: Search how renderer sends data (e.g., `grep "window.electronAPI.send.*channel-name"`).
   - Function calls: Search existing callers for parameter formats.
   - Types: Check existing definitions.
   - **Ensure compatibility with existing callers**.
3. **Analyze architecture and dependencies**.
4. **Identify unused content**.
5. **Select tools**.

#### Phase 3: Plan & Reflect
**Must include**:
1. **Requirement Analysis**.
2. **Existing Implementation Analysis (CRITICAL)**: Data formats, call patterns, compatibility check.
3. **Impact Scope**: Files to modify, new files, doc updates.
4. **Implementation Scheme**: Data flow, component design, IPC design (must match existing format), state management.
5. **Implementation Steps**: Detailed steps with tools. **Verify compatibility**.
6. **Risk Assessment**: Electron boundaries, HDR/EDR, performance, backward compatibility, type safety.
7. **Test Plan**: Functional points, edge cases, compatibility tests.
8. **Reflection Check**: Is the plan complete? Existing implementation analyzed? Compatible?

#### Phase 4: Wait
Ensure user agreement before code modification.

#### Phase 5: Implement & Review
1. **Execute subtasks**: Follow the plan strictly.
2. **Tool usage**: Batch operations.
3. **Code quality check**: Style consistency, existing patterns, type safety.
4. **Real-time review**: Check for errors after each file.
5. **Documentation update**: **Update `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` immediately**.
6. **Final review**.

## 🏗️ Architecture Rules

**Important**: Detailed project architecture is in `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

**Force Rule**: Architecture documentation must be updated in real-time, not depending on user reminders.

### Scenarios requiring updates
1. **Interface changes**: Update Chapter 3 (Core Interfaces & Data Structures).
2. **Data structure changes**: Update Chapter 4 (Data Structure Definitions).
3. **IPC communication changes**: Update Chapter 5 (IPC Communication Design).
4. **File changes**: Update Section 12.2 (File Path Reference).
5. **Architecture changes**: Update Chapter 2 (Overall Layered Architecture).

### Update Check
In the **same round of work** as code modification:
- [ ] Determine if the change affects architecture docs.
- [ ] If yes, update `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` immediately.
- [ ] Use the update checklist (Section 13.3).
- [ ] Update "Last Updated" date.
- [ ] Ensure docs match code.

## 💻 Code Standards

### File Organization
- **One file per class/interface**.
- **Unified entry file**: Infrastructure modules should provide `index.ts`.
- **Type classification**: Related types in `types.ts`.
- **Lazy loading**: Encapsulate native binding loading.

### TypeScript
- Strict mode, type safety.
- Use interfaces for contracts.
- Avoid `any`, use `unknown` or specific types.

## 🧠 Tech Stack Skills

### Vue 3 Composition Expert
- **Script Setup**: Always use `<script setup lang="ts">`.
- **Composables**: Extract logic into `composables/useFeature.ts` instead of large components.
- **Props/Emits**: Use `defineProps` and `defineEmits` with full type definitions.
- **Reactivity**: Prefer `ref` over `reactive` for clarity on what is reactive (requires `.value`).

### Electron IPC Architect
- **Type Safety**: All IPC channels must be typed in `src/common/types.ts`.
- **Context Isolation**: Never expose `ipcRenderer` directly. Use `contextBridge`.
- **Validation**: Validate all inputs in the Main process before use.

### Technical Documentation Expert
- **Visual Communication**: Use Mermaid.js for complex state machines and data flows.
- **API Standardization**: Use JSDoc/TSDoc standards.
- **Style Guide**: "Clear, Concise, Active Voice" (Google Style).
- **Single Source of Truth**: `ARCHITECTURE.md` is the master.
- **Code-Doc Sync**: Treat documentation as code.
